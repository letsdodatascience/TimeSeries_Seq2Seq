# TimeSeries_Seq2Seq
This repo aims to be a useful collection of notebooks/code for understanding and implementing seq2seq neural networks for time series forecasting. Networks are constructed with keras/tensorflow. 

## Instructions for Working With Notebooks:

Navigate to the directory you want the git repo to live in.

1. Run ```git clone https://github.com/JEddy92/TimeSeries_Seq2Seq.git```
2. Obtain the wikipedia web traffic data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting/data).
   Store it in a folder called "data" at the top level of this repo (this is where the notebooks point to when reading data).
